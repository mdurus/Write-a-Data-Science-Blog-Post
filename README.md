* What is the environment of professional developer? I would like to understand working environment, education and diversity around them.

* Is there a correlation between diversity of their environment and their thinking about the importance of diversity across the world? I would like to understand their view to diversity and show the similarities and differences between other cultures?

* Is there a sign to change the diversity in short term? I would like to analyze diversity among students as a follower of professionals.
